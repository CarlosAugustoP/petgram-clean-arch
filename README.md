# PetGram - Clean Architecture + CQRS

Still in progress!

PetGram is a social media for pets! It allows users to have common social media interactions about pets such as posts, messages, comments, likes, and more.

Stacks used: PostgreSQL (Main DB), HangFire (Cron jobs), SignalR (Web Sockets), Redis (Caching), .NET Core (back-end), Python (machine learning), Next js (front-end), Docker (container management), Supabase (image storage), Flask + Tensorflow (Pet Discerning Model).
