# PetGram - Clean Architecture + CQRS

Still in progress!

PetGram is a social media for pets! It allows users to have common social media interactions about pets such as posts, messages, comments, likes, and more.

Stacks used: PostgreSQL (Main DB), SQLite (Offline data management), Redis (Caching), ASP.NET Core (back-end), Python (machine learning), Vue js (front-end), Docker (container management), Supabase (image storage).
